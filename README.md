# DOM Calculator

Right now just brushing up on my use of git and also DOM.

## Firstly I created a simple set of files to play around with, the calculator is still a work in progress.

## Secondly I got things ready for get using the following terminal commands:

Initialise git in the current directory

	git init 

Create an empty README markdown file

    touch README.md

Add the current files in the directory

    git add .

Check that all the current files are ready to be commited

    git status

Commit the current files

	git commit -m 'first commit'

Add repo to be sync'd with

	git remote add origin https://github.com/DJNgoma/DOM_Calculator.git

Push current files to master branch

	git push -u origin master

Now Hope for the best!

	// Cross fingers.

Realising I have to add the changed files to git again as it only pushed the old README.

	git add README.md

Pushing to the master branch again

	git push -u origin master

## Misc

To save myself the hassle of guessing the output of the markdown text written I used [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview) in Sublime Text 3.

Also used [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5983680/how-the-heck-do-i-use-github) for a quick brush up of the commands. Hopefully it should end up commiting the commands to memory soon enough.
